# Numeric vs experimental end velocity of a uniform body

This repo contains code for numeric analysis, in cubicspline, and the post processing, in average.py, for motion of a uniform ball alonge a given track.

## Cubicspline.py

Contains the numeric analysis of the uniform body. The program will generate a track, where a plot of this can be found at img/baneform.png
![track form](https://github.com/Sivaranjith1/fysikk_lab/blob/readme/img/baneform.svg?raw=true "Form of track")

To reproduce the experiment recreate this track.

## Average.py

Contains the post processing of data tracking from Tracker.
